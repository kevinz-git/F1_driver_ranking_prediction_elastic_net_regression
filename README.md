# Homework #4: model building and tracking

**Instructions**: For this assignment, weâ€™d like you to use the F1 Datasets we have been using for the class to build any ML model of your choice and track the model for each run using [**MLflow**](https://www.mlflow.org). Select any of the F1 datasets in AWS S3 to build your model. You are allowed to join multiple datasets.

1. [`20 pts`] Build any model of your choice with tunable hyperparameters
2. [`20 pts`] Create an experiment setup where - for each run - you log:
	* the hyperparameters used in the model
	* the model itself
	* every possible metric from the model you chose
	* at least two artifacts (plots, or csv files)
3. [`20 pts`] Track your MLFlow experiment and run at least 10 experiments with different parameters each
4. [`20 pts`] Select your best model run and explain why
5. [`20 pts`] As part of your GitHub classroom submission include screenshots of
	* your MLFlow Homepage

	* your detailed run page
